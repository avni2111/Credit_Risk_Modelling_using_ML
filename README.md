In this project, I have build a Credit Risk Modeling system using Python and Machine Learning from scratch. I learn how to process real-world financial data, apply Scikit-learn for model training, and deploy an interactive dashboard with Streamlit. It help me understand how to evaluate credit risk, handle imbalanced datasets, and create a complete end-to-end data science project in Python.
